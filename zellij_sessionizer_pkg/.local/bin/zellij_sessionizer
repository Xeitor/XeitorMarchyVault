# Just for zellij
# alows you to use `fzf` to navigate into a desire folder and either start or attach into a zellij session
# If you run it from inside zellij, it will open the newly selected folder in a new pane

# Demo of the original: https://youtu.be/bdumjiHabhQ?t=269

# 1. Place the script in your path
# 2. Create an alias to call this script in your shells .rc config:
#    bindkey -s ^f "zellij_sessionizer\n"
# 3. Update where you want to search:
#    I'm using `fd` to perform the search inside a specific dir, you can use that or `find`

else
	selected=$(find ~/wispro ~/github_projects ~/github_projects/metabrainz ~/github_projects/music_maniacs -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | fzf)

# We're inside zellij so we'll open a new pane and move into the selected directory

# Hopefully they'll someday support specifying a directory and this won't be as laggy
# thanks to @msirringhaus for getting this from the community some time ago!
